Beskrivning

Make a python program to build a C project with any structure (assume that in every module the header file and the source file have the same name).

To find programs, search in the source files. If a source file has implemented the main function, it is a program.

To find dependencies of a program you can read and extract the dependencies from the .d file of the program.

based on the content of the .d file, you can find the object files needed to link in order to build the program.
