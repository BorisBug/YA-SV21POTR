Requirements
 
1. The function should interpolate the name in a simple greeting. 
For example, when name is "Bob", the method should return a string "Hello, Bob.".

2. Handle nulls by introducing a stand-in.
For example, when name is null, then the method should return the string "Hello, my friend."

3. Handle shouting. When name is all uppercase, then the method should shout back to the user.
For example, when name is "JERRY" then the method should return the string "HELLO JERRY!"

4. Handle two names of input. When name is a string of two names, then both names should be printed. 
For example, when name is "Jill, Jane", then the method should return the string "Hello, Jill and Jane."

5. Handle an arbitrary number of names as input. When name represents more than two names, separate them with commas and close with an Oxford comma and "and".
For example, when name is "Amy, Brian, Charlotte", then the method should return the string "Hello, Amy, Brian, and Charlotte."
  
6. Allow mixing of normal and shouted names by separating the response into two greetings.
For example, when name is "Amy, BRIAN, Charlotte", then the method should return the string "Hello, Amy and Charlotte. AND HELLO BRIAN!"
