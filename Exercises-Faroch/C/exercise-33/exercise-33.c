Beskrivning
Read about the hanoi tower puzzle and solve it for 64 disks.
https://romek.info/games/hanoi3e.html

Make a program to find how many years it takes to move 64 disks
from a peg to another one if each move takes 1 second.

    /* From google...
    If you had 64 golden disks you would have to use a minimum of 2^64-1 moves.
    If each move took one second, it would take around 585 billion years to complete the puzzle!
