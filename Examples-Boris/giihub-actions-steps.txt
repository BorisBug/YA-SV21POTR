1• Create private repo on GitHub and include the readme file (to have an initial commit)

2• Clone repository locally https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
- move to a directory where you want your repository
- git clone https://....your-repo

3• Create develop branch and switch
- git branch			--> it should be master or main only
- git branch develop	--> create branch develop (under main/master)
- git switch develop	--> switch to develop
- git branch			--> it should be develop and master/main

4• Copy or create the project structure.
   Folders: Lib, Src, Test.. and Files: .gitignore, Makefile, etc.
   In this example we use Faroch's code from FizzBuzzWhiz (Week 48 > examples > artifacts.zip).
   Note that we are now standing on develop branch.

5• After copying or creating, we try to compile and see if everything is actually working. 
   Run make using the given Makefile and its targets (ex: make clean, make check, etc..).
   This makefile you can use on the assignment 80% as it is.
- make
- make clean
- make check
- make run NUM=154

5• Verify that you have the YAML file(s) on .github/workflows, 
  and be sure that the compilation commands on the section "build" are
  reproduced exactly as you do locally on your terminal.
  These files you can use on the assignment 95% as they already are.

6• Verify that in the YAML file the names of the branches are similar as yours.
   That means.. 'main' should be main, or 'master' should be master.
   You can check this on the bottom left corner of VS.

7• Add the new files and folders into your local repository.
   Good to check before and after to ensure that git is doing exactly what you want.
- git branch
- git status
- git add .
- git status

8• Commit everything
- git commit -m "added files and folders"
- git status

9• Push to GitHub.
  If you just push you will get an error because in GitHub there is no develop branch,
  and because this branch is ahead of origin.
- git push      	--> error
- git push --set-upstream origin develop

10• In this example everything is ready, then we can continue and create a version. That means merge develop with master/main.
- git switch master
- git pull		--> in a real scenario here you should check that there are no conflicts
- git merge develop
- git push
